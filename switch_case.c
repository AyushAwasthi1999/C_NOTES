// Switch Statement
// Instead of writing many if..else statements, you can use the switch statement.

/*
    This is how it works:

        The switch expression is evaluated once
        The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case
        If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed
        The break statement breaks out of the switch block and stops the execution
        The default statement is optional, and specifies some code to run if there is no case match
